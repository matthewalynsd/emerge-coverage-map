# emerge-coverage-map
This is a LeafletJS powered map to display home internet coverage areas offered by Emerge Technology.

Map coverage data was provided via KML/KMZ files, which can be converted to GeoJSONs for more adaptable use and styling.
The map is delivered through a shortcode that is placed on the front-end WordPress installation.
LeafletJS is a required library, and can be found here: https://leafletjs.com/
